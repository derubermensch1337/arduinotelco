In the setup, the bitrate for communication is set.

Then, during the loop, the Arduino will continually check if there is any data in the
input buffer that hasn't been processed yet. If there is, it prints a status message to serial
showing what the information in there is. Serial.read() only reads one byte at a time, so longer messages sent over serial shall be printed out piecewise.
