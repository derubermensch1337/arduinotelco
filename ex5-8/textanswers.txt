5a)

In the setup, the bitrate for communication is set.

Then, during the loop, the Arduino will continually check if there is any data in the
input buffer that hasn't been processed yet. If there is, it prints a status message to serial
showing what the information in there is. Serial.read() only reads one byte at a time, so longer messages sent over serial shall be printed out piecewise.

5d)

We are directly printing the byte value of the first piece of data recieved.

5e) 

A line ending returns a byte value of 10, or dec, as it is used in the code provided in the question. So a 10 is printed following the other characters in the serial input.

5f)

We are declaring the type of incomingByte to be a char - this forces the compiler to read the byte as a character datatype, so it refers to the ASCII code.
a similar effect is achieved if you change line 9 of the example code to:
	char incomingByte = Serial.read()


6a)

A char is the smallest datatype capable of representing characters, rather than numbers. It uses a minimum of 8 bits (1 byte :D )

6b)

The resulting character is D - this makes sense, following character arithmetic - in essence, we are taking the bit value for A, adding 4 and subtracting 1 - pushing us 3 registers to the right, giving us D (3rd letter after A)


7a)

An RGB value is a 24-bit unsigned representation of the 'presence' of the colors Red, Green and Blue. Each color is assigned 8 bits to represent the hue strength, resulting in each color being assigned a value between 0-255.

7b)

Serial.parseInt() returns the first integer to be found in a serial input - this could be useful for parsing a single input that contains both words and numbers.
