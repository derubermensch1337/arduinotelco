9a) According to the datasheet for our TMP36, the scale factor for our reading is 10mV/C. Following this, it is easy to derive the knowledge that each the temperature in C is (V/100), where V is the voltage reading off of the sensor.

9b) The code initializes a char variable, and proceeds to iterate over an expression and printing it - Serial.print(c) will run 5 times, printing 0,2,4,6,8 whilst Serial.write(176), which corresponds to the degree sign.

9c) print() statements parse and output any variable you put in them, e.g. strings, integers, floats. Meanwhile, write() statements output the byte size of whatever parameter you place within it.

9f) Yes, it works!
